List as of 5/24/20:

1. Complete implementation of item system. I estimate it's currently 75% done for acheiving barebones functionality.
2. Revise fight engine to utilize curnpc.isalive to determine state as opposed to the current "result" system. Not started.
3. Add in races for PC Character and non-monster npcs. Not started.
4. Extend dungeon code to drop items. Not started.
5. Have code start recognizing player death. Not started.

KNOWN BUGS:

1. Fight engine sometimes executes two turns in a row, both successfully attacking. I am hoping item 2 on TODO will fix this, as I can't 
figure out why it's happening.

Will be updated periodically.

Updates:

5/24/20 - 11:25pm 
-- Added PC armor slots and added a few extra fields to player data structure. 
-- Added routine to reset armor slots.
-- Armor is final component of barebones inventory system. Barebones item functionality is about 90% complete right now.
