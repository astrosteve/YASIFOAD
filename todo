List as of 5/24/20:

1. Complete implementation of item system. I estimate it's currently 75% done for acheiving barebones functionality.
2. Revise fight engine to utilize curnpc.isalive to determine state as opposed to the current "result" system. Not started.
3. Add in races for PC Character and non-monster npcs. Not started.
4. Extend dungeon code to drop items. Not started.
5. Have code start recognizing player death. Not started.

KNOWN BUGS:

1. Fight engine sometimes executes two turns in a row, both successfully attacking. I am hoping item 2 on TODO will fix this, as I can't 
figure out why it's happening.

2. Integer overflow on range() on Linux. Fix is trivial.

OTHER:

1. Some versions of gcc report "choice" in enemyatk is unused. This is incorrect and is a bug in gcc. Not attempting to fix it at this point.

Will be updated periodically.
